# 🏥 📈 Medical Conditions & Patient Time Analysis – Power BI Interactive Dashboard

This project walks through the end-to-end creation of a Power BI dashboard analyzing medical conditions and patient time metrics using publicly available healthcare data (2018–2021).
It covers the full lifecycle — from requirement gathering to final deployment.

## 📊 Objective
Track and analyze the **patient waiting list** across Inpatient & Outpatient categories with:

- Current status monitoring  
- Historical monthly trends  
- Specialty-level & age profile analysis  

---

## 🔍 Process Overview
1. **Requirement Gathering** – Identify stakeholders, define KPIs, outline scope.  
2. **Data Collection** – Connect to source data (folder connector in this case).  
3. **Data Transformation & Modelling** – Clean, standardize, append, and create relationships in Power Query.  
4. **Visualization Blueprint** – Wireframe the dashboard before development.  
5. **Dashboard Layout & Design** – Create DAX measures, visuals, and page layouts.  
6. **Adding Interactivity** – Navigation buttons, slicers, tooltips, and conditional visuals.  
7. **Testing & Validation** – Verify calculations, visuals, and user experience.  
8. **Sharing & Maintenance** – Publish to Power BI Service, schedule refresh.
